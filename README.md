# Linesia-Core

This core was created for the Linesia server for PocketMine-MP version 4. It contains the basic systems needed to run a Minecraft server. This core contains work mostly from me but may contain basic and low-level code from other uncredited developers.

## Warning

This code may not be used to reproduce or imitate an existing server.
